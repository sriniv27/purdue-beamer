@article{Lee1998,
abstract = {Studies of sensory guidance of movement in animals show that large nervous systems are not necessary for accurate control, suggesting that guidance may be based on some simple principles. In search for those principles, a theory of guidance of movement is described, which has its roots in Gibson's pathfinding work on visual control of locomotion (J. J. Gibson, 1958/this issue). The theory is based on the use of the simple but powerful variable tau, the time-to-closure of a gap at the current gap closure rate (whatever the gap's dimension—distance, angle, force, etc.); and on the principle of tau-coupling (keeping two Ts in constant ratio). In this article, I show how tau-coupling could be used to synchronize movements and regulate their kinematics. Supportive experimental results are reported. I also show theoretically how sensory-taus, defined on sensory input arrays, can specify motion-taus through tau-coupling; how the braking procedure of keeping tau.dot stable is a particular case of tau.coupling; an...},

abstract = {the number of parameters that require adaptation, and helps to avoid control input saturation. These desirable characteristics make the ARC-LMI control algorithm well suited for the quadrotor, which may have unknown parameters and may encounter external disturbances such as wind gusts and turbulence. This thesis develops the ARC-LMI attitude and position controllers for an X-configuration quadrotor helicopter. The inner-loop of the autopilot controls the attitude and altitude of the quadrotor, and the outer-loop controls its position in the earth-fixed coordinate frame. Furthermore, by intelligently generating a smooth trajectory from the given reference coordinates, the transient performance is improved. The simulation results indicate that the ARC-LMI controller design is useful for a variety of quadrotor applications, includ- ing precise trajectory tracking, autonomous waypoint navigation in the presence of disturbances, and package delivery without loss of performance.},

abstract = {Inspired by the general tau theory in animal motion planning, a collision-free four-dimensional (4D) trajectory generation method is presented for multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). This method can generate a group of optimal or near-optimal collision-free 4D trajectories, the position and velocity of which are synchronously planned in accordance with the arrival time. To enlarge the shape adjustment capability of trajectories with zero initial acceleration, a new strategy named intrinsic tau harmonic guidance strategy is proposed on the basis of general tau theory and harmonic motion. In the case of multiple UAVs, the 4D trajectories generated by the new strategy are optimized by the bionic Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. In order to ensure flight safety, the protected airspace zone is used for collision detection, and two collision resolution approaches are applied to resolve the remaining conflicts after global trajectory optimization. Numerous simulation results of the simultaneous arrival missions demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively provide more flyable and safer 4D trajectories than that of the existing methods.},

Strategies are developed for the planning and control of two-dimensional landing maneuvers under a time-to-contact control framework. The proposed scheme is implemented on a small research quadrotor and assessed through extensive simulations and flight testing.

A method, based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process for multi-criteria decision-making problems, is then proposed for this automation task. In order to evaluate its effectiveness, the proposed method along with a low-fidelity synthetic environment is modeled in Simulink{\textregistered} for fast-time simulations. A simulation trial with 1606 encounter samples and three candidates is used to illustrate the exceptional encounters where an automation function may fail to return to the cleared route in a reasonable time. The simulation results show that the proposed method is able to handle these exceptional encounters.},

abstract = {The popularity of quadcopters are increasing as the sensors and control systems are getting more advanced. The quadcopter is naturally unstable, has a complex dynamic model and six degrees of freedom. Even with four motors it is underactuated, and cannot move translative without rotating about one of its axes. There are many commercially quadcopters for sale, but was not considered as it would result in a backwards design process where the design is decided before the needs. To meet the university's lab facilities a quadcopter was designed to fit a single board RIO from National Instruments. This is the preferred platform used by the university and it has high performance characteristics. The quadcopter requires an extensive control system in order to fly. With many parameters it is difficult to implement and tune a regulator for such a system. In addition to an even more complex regulator many sensors are needed in order to make the quadcopter autonomous. For the attitude estimation sensor fusion is required to get a robust and reliable measurement. Based on the dynamic model the sensors needed was chosen. They were tested one by one before implementation in a control system. A tilt regulator was able to stabilize the quadcopter around one axis in a test rig. Building a quadcopter for an educational purpose, and to discover and resolve its complexity is an experimental project, as this has never been done at this university. The final quadcopter concept is well suited for further experimental work.},

abstract = {Finding the location of feature points in 3D space from 2D vision data in structured environments has been done successfully for years and has been applied effectively on industrial robots. Miniature flying robots flying in unknown environments have stringent weight, space, and security constraints. For such vehicles, it has been attempted here to reduce the number of vision sensors to a single camera. At first, feature points are detected in the image using Harris corner detector, the measurements of which are then statistically corresponded across various images, using knowledge of vehicle's pose from onboard inertial measurement unit. First approach attempted is that of ego-motion perpendicular to camera axis and acceptable results for 3D feature point locations have been achieved. Next, except for a small region around the focus of expansion, forward translations along the camera axis have also been attempted with acceptable results, which is an improvement to the previous relevant work. The 3D location map of feature points thus obtained is utilizable for trajectory planning while ensuring collision avoidance through 3D space. Reduction of vision sensors to a single camera while utilizing minimum ego-motion space for 3D feature point location is a significant contribution of this work.},

abstract = {Quad-Rotor Control develops original control methods for the navigation and hovering flight of an autonomous mini-quad-rotor robotic helicopter. These methods use an imaging system and a combination of inertial and altitude sensors to localize and guide the movement of the unmanned aerial vehicle relative to its immediate environment. The history, classification and applications of UAVs are introduced, followed by a description of modelling techniques for quad-rotors and the experimental platform itself. A control strategy for the improvement of attitude stabilization in quad-rotors is then proposed and tested in real-time experiments. The strategy, based on the use of low-cost components and with experimentally-established robustness, avoids drift in the UAV's angular position by the addition of an internal control loop to each electronic speed controller ensuring that, during hovering flight, all four motors turn at almost the same speed. The quad-rotor's Euler angles being very close to the origin, other sensors like GPS or image-sensing equipment can be incorporated to perform autonomous positioning or trajectory-tracking tasks. Two vision-based strategies, each designed to deal with a specific kind of mission, are introduced and separately tested. The first stabilizes the quad-rotor over a landing pad on the ground; it extracts the 3-dimensional position using homography estimation and derives translational velocity by optical flow calculation. The second combines colour-extraction and line-detection algorithms to control the quad-rotor's 3-dimensional position and achieves forward velocity regulation during a road-following task. In order to estimate the translational-dynamical characteristics of the quad-rotor (relative position and translational velocity) as they evolve within a building or other unstructured, GPS-deprived environment, imaging, inertial and altitude sensors are combined in a state observer. The text gives the reader a current view of the problems encountered in UAV control, specifically those relating to quad-rotor flying machines and it will interest researchers and graduate students working in that field. The vision-based control strategies presented help the reader to a better understanding of how an imaging system can be used to obtain the information required for performance of the hovering and navigation tasks ubiquitous in rotored UAV operation.},

abstract = {Quadcopter, also known as quadrotor, is a helicopter with four rotors. The rotors are directed upwards and they are placed in a square formation with equal distance from the center of mass of the quadcopter. The quadcopter is controlled by adjusting the angular velocities of the rotors which are spun by electric motors. Quadcopter is a typical design for small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) because of the simple structure. Quadcopters are used in surveillance, search and rescue, construction inspections and several other applications. Quadcopter has received considerable attention from researchers as the complex phenomena of the quadcopter has generated several areas of interest. The basic dynamical model of the quadcopter is the starting point for all of the studies but more complex aerodynamic properties has been introduced as well [1, 2]. Different control methods has been researched, including PID controllers [3, 4, 5, 6], backstepping control [7, 8], nonlinear H∞ control [9], LQR controllers [6], and nonlinear controllers with nested saturations [10, 11]. Control methods require accurate information from the position and attitude measurements performed with a gyroscope, an accelerometer, and other measuring devices, such as GPS, and sonar and laser sensors [12, 13]. The purpose of this paper is to present the basics of quadcopter modelling and control as to form a basis for further research and development in the area. This is pursued with two aims. The first aim is to study the mathematical mo del of the quadcopter dynamics. The second aim is to develop proper methods for stabilisation and trajectory control of the quadcopter. The challenge in controlling a quadcopter is that the quadcopter has six degrees of freedom but there are only four control inputs. This paper presents the differential equations of the quadcopter dynamics. They are derived from both the Newton-Euler equations and the Euler-Lagrange equations which are both used in the study of quadcopters. The behaviour of the model is examined by simulating the flight of the quadcopter. Stabilisation of the quadcopter is conducted by utilising a PD controller. The PD controller is a simple con trol method which is easy to implement as the control method of the quadcopter. A simple heuristic method is developed to control the trajectory of the flight. Then a PD controller is integrated into the heuristic method to reduce the effect of the fluctuations in quadcopter behaviour caused by random external forces. The following section presents the mathematical model of a quadcopter. In the third section, the mathematical model is tested by simulating the quadcopter with given control inputs. The fourth section presents a PD controller to stabilise the quadcopter. In the fifth section, a heuristic method including a PD controller is presented to control the trajectory of quadcopter flight. The last section contains the conlusion of the paper.},

abstract = {Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) with perching capabilities can be used to efficiently place sensors in aloft locations. A major challenge for perching is to build a lightweight mechanism that can be easily mounted on a MAV, allowing it to perch (attach and detach on command) to walls of different materials. To date, only very few systems have been proposed that aim at enabling MAVs with perching capabilities. Typically, these solutions either require a delicate dynamic flight maneuver in front of the wall or expose the MAV to very high impact forces when colliding head-first with the wall. In this article, we propose a 4.6{\^{A}} g perching mechanism that allows MAVs to perch on walls of natural and man-made materials such as trees and painted concrete facades of buildings. To do this, no control for the MAV is needed other than flying head-first into the wall. The mechanism is designed to translate the impact impulse into a snapping movement that sticks small needles into the surface and uses a small electric motor to detach from the wall and recharge the mechanism for the next perching sequence. Based on this principle, it damps the impact forces that act on the platform to avoid damage of the MAV. We performed 110 sequential perches on a variety of substrates with a success rate of 100{\%}. The main contributions of this article are (i) the evaluation of different designs of perching, (ii) the description and formal modeling of a novel perching mechanism, and (iii) the demonstration and characterization of a functional prototype on a microglider.

abstract = {The inherent uncertainty associated with unstructured environments makes establishing a successful grasp difficult. Traditional approaches to this problem involve hands that are complex, fragile, require elaborate sensor suites, and are difficult to control. Alternatively, by carefully designing the mechanical structure of the hand to incorporate features such as compliance and adaptability, the uncertainty inherent in unstructured grasping tasks can be more easily accommodated. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel adaptive and compliant grasper that can grasp objects spanning a wide range of size, shape, mass, and position/orientation using only a single actuator. The hand is constructed using polymer-based Shape Deposition Manufacturing (SDM) and has superior robustness properties, making it able to withstand large impacts without damage. We also present the results of two experiments to demonstrate that the SDM Hand can reliably grasp objects in the presence of large positioning errors, while keeping acquisition contact forces low. In the first, we evaluate the amount of allowable manipulator positioning error that results in a successful grasp. In the second experiment, the hand autonomously grasps a wide range of spherical objects positioned randomly across the workspace, guided by only a single image from an overhead camera, using feed-forward control of the hand.},

abstract = {The grasping capability of birds' feet is a hallmark of their evolution, but the mechanics of avian foot function are not well understood. Two evolutionary trends that contribute to the mechanical complexity of the avian foot are the variation in the relative lengths of the phalanges and the subdivision and variation of the digital flexor musculature observed among taxa. We modelled the grasping behaviour of a simplified bird foot in response to the downward and upward forces imparted by carrying and perching tasks, respectively. Specifically, we compared the performance of various foot geometries performing these tasks when actuated by distally inserted flexors only, versus by both distally inserted and proximally inserted flexors. Our analysis demonstrates that most species possess relative phalanx lengths that are conducive to grasps actuated only by a single distally inserted tendon per digit. Furthermore, proximally inserted flexors are often required during perching, but the distally inserted flexors are sufficient when grasping and carrying objects. These results are reflected in differences in the relative development of proximally and distally inserted digital flexor musculature among ‘perching' and ‘grasping' taxa. Thus, our results shed light on the relative roles of variation in phalanx length and digit flexor muscle distribution in an integrative, mechanical context.},

abstract = {Vision is arguably the most widely used sensor for position and velocity estimation in animals, and it is increasingly used in robotic systems as well. Many animals use stereopsis and object recognition in order to make a true estimate of distance. For a tiny insect such as a fruit fly or honeybee, however, these methods fall short. Instead, an insect must rely on calculations of optic flow, which can provide a measure of the ratio of velocity to distance, but not either parameter independently. Nevertheless, flies and other insects are adept at landing on a variety of substrates, a behavior that inherently requires some form of distance estimation in order to trigger distance-appropriate motor actions such as deceleration or leg extension. Previous studies have shown that these behaviors are indeed under visual control, raising the question: how does an insect estimate distance solely using optic flow? In this paper we use a nonlinear control theoretic approach to propose a solution for this problem. Our algorithm takes advantage of visually controlled landing trajectories that have been observed in flies and honeybees. Finally, we implement our algorithm, which we term dynamic peering,using a camera mounted to a linear stage to demonstrate its real-world feasibility},

abstract = {Birds routinely execute post-stall maneuvers with a speed and precision far beyond the capabilities of our best aircraft control systems. One remarkable example is a bird exploiting post-stall pressure drag in order to rapidly decelerate to land on a perch. Stall is typically associated with a loss of control authority, and it is tempting to attribute this agility of birds to the intricate morphology of the wings and tail, to their precision sensing apparatus, or their ability to perform thrust vectoring. Here we ask whether an extremely simple fixed-wing glider (no propeller) with only a single actuator in the tail is capable of landing precisely on a perch from a large range of initial conditions. To answer this question, we focus on the design of the flight control system; building upon previous work which used linear feedback control design based on quadratic regulators (LQR), we develop nonlinear feedback control based on nonlinear model-predictive control and 'LQR-Trees'. Through simulation using a flat-plate model of the glider, we find that both nonlinear methods are capable of achieving an accurate bird-like perching maneuver from a large range of initial conditions; the 'LQR-Trees' algorithm is particularly useful due to its low computational burden at runtime and its inherent performance guarantees. With this in mind, we then implement the 'LQR-Trees' algorithm on real hardware and demonstrate a 95 percent perching success rate over 147 flights for a wide range of initial speeds. These results suggest that, at least in the absence of significant disturbances like wind gusts, complex wing morphology and sensing are not strictly required to achieve accurate and robust perching even in the post-stall flow regime.},

abstract = {This thesis presents an implementation of autonomous indoor perching using only onboard sensors on a low-cost, custom-built quadrotor. The perching aggressive maneuver is representative of a class of control problems for aerobatics that requires an agile and robust control system for maneuvering accurately at high speeds. Such research extends the typical functionality of micro air vehicles (MAV) from low speed and stationary observation to dynamic aerobatic transitions for broader operational capabilities including confined landings and evasive maneuvering. To achieve this, three major challenges are overcome: precise and real-time positioning, sensing of the perch and path to the perch, and control methods for robust and accurate tracking at high speeds. Navigation in unstructured, global positioning system (GPS)-denied environments is achieved using a visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithm that relies on an onboard monocular camera. A secondary camera, capable of detecting infrared light sources, is used to locate the pathway for the maneuver and the perch, simulating sensing of the actual perch, for perching without prior knowledge of the location of the perch. The full physical system architecture is covered in detail, indicating the components and integration necessary to obtain effective aggressive control of an inexpensive quadrotor. The difficulties of attitude stabilization on noisy and lower-quality sensors are successfully addressed so that the air vehicle can be treated as a simple second-order system for the purposes of navigation and response to dynamic maneuvering commands. The system utilizes nested controllers for attitude stabilization, vision-based navigation, and perching guidance, with the navigation controller implemented using novel nonlinear saturation control within a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) structure. The quadrotor is therefore able to autonomously sense the perch, reach initial high speeds for obtaining rapid deceleration from aerodynamic effects, dynamically transition to a high angle of attack post-stall configuration, and make a low-speed accurate landing on an inclined surface, using only onboard sensors.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the dynamics, control, planning, and visual servoing for micro aerial vehicles to perform high-speed aerial grasping tasks. We draw inspiration from agile, fast-moving birds, such as raptors, that detect, locate, and execute high-speed swoop maneuvers to capture prey. Since these grasping maneuvers are predominantly in the sagittal plane, we consider the planar system and present mathematical models and algorithms for motion planning and control, required to incorporate similar capabilities in quadrotors equipped with a monocular camera. In particular, we develop a dynamical model directly in the image space, show that this is a differentially-flat system with the image features serving as flat outputs, outline a method for generating trajectories directly in the image feature space, develop a geometric visual controller that considers the second order dynamics (in contrast to most visual servoing controllers that assume first order dynamics), and present validation of our methods through both simulations and experiments.},

abstract = {Micro aerial vehicles, particularly quadrotors, have been used in a wide range of applications. However, the literature on aerial manipulation and grasping is limited and the work is based on quasi-static models. In this paper, we draw inspiration from agile, fast-moving birds such as raptors, that are able to capture moving prey on the ground or in water, and develop similar capabilities for quadrotors. We address dynamic grasping, an approach to prehensile grasping in which the dynamics of the robot and its gripper are significant and must be explicitly modeled and controlled for successful execution. Dynamic grasping is relevant for fast pick-and-place operations, transportation and delivery of objects, and placing or retrieving sensors. We show how this capability can be realized (a) using a motion capture system and (b) without external sensors relying only on onboard sensors. In both cases we describe the dynamic model, and trajectory planning and control algorithms. In particular, we present a methodology for flying and grasping a cylindrical object using feedback from a monocular camera and an inertial measurement unit onboard the aerial robot. This is accomplished by mapping the dynamics of the quadrotor to a level virtual image plane, which in turn enables dynamically-feasible trajectory planning for image features in the image space, and a vision-based controller with guaranteed convergence properties. We also present experimental results obtained with a quadrotor equipped with an articulated gripper to illustrate both approaches.},

abstract = {Flying robots capable of perch-and-stare are desirable for reconnaissance missions. Current solutions for perch-and-stare applications utilize various methods to create an aircraft that can land on a limited set of surfaces that are typically horizontal or vertical planes. This paper presents a bio-inspired concept that allows for passive perching on cylindrical-type surfaces. The prototype provides compliant gripping through the use of an underactuated foot. A mechanism inspired by songbird anatomy is integrated that utilizes rotorcraft weight as a way to passively actuate the foot. Successful perching trials on two rods of differing diameters were performed and are discussed. The purpose of this initial design is to act as a proof of concept for the mechanical action of the mechanism; our results demonstrate that passive perching can be achieved through the integration of underactuated gripping with mechanism-generated mechanical advantage.},

abstract = {Most robotic grasping research focuses on objects that are either not large in comparison to the gripper or have small graspable features; however, there are important applications that involve large flat or gently curved surfaces. Examples include robots that grasp the solar panels of space craft, handle large panels in manufacturing, or climb or perch on surfaces. We present a solution for grasping such surfaces consisting of groups of tiles coated with a controllable gecko-inspired adhesive. The tiles are loaded with two sets of tendons: one for distributing the forces evenly while grasping and the other for release. The gripper is passive and can attach and detach with little effort so that it does not disturb either the robot or the object to be grasped. The maximum gripping force in the normal direction can be over 1000 times greater than the required detaching force. The gripper is also fast, allowing a flying quadrotor to attach to a surface milliseconds after the tiles make contact. We present a model of the gripping mechanism and use the model to design the layout of the tiles to best support anticipated normal and tangential loads. },

Merging these two modes of movement is achieved via a mechanism utilizing an opposed grip with directional adhesives. Critical design considerations include (a) climbing mechanism weight constraints, (b) suitable body geometry for climbing and (c) effects of impact dynamics. The robot uses a symmetric linkage and cam mechanism to load and detach the feet while climbing. The lengths of key parameters, including the distances between each the feet and the tail, are chosen based on the ratio of required preload force and detachment force for the adhesive mechanism.},

abstract = {This paper details an autonomous perching and take-off method for a quadrotor micro air vehicle (MAV) using a novel dry adhesive gripper on smooth vertical walls. The gripper mechanism uses three directional dry adhesive pads in a triangular configuration. Each pad is equipped with a force sensor that can detect the pad's loading condition. A servo motor is used to actuate the attachment and detachment of the gripper, which is mounted in the front of a quadrotor MAV. This makes perching possible by simply flying toward and hitting the target surface. Autonomous control is made possible using a Microsoft Kinect to localize the MAV and a PID controller to control the perching maneuver. Experiments show that a minimum speed of 0.4m/s is required to guarantee a successful perch. Also, in 93{\%} of the experiments in which the MAV hits the target at a speed higher than 0.4m/s, the perching maneuver is successful. To initiate a take-off procedure, a release signal is sent to the servo and the gripper is detached from the wall by pulling the adhesive away from the surface. Once the gripper is detached, the MAV becomes airborne again and the control system stabilizes the flight.},

Animals are adept at coping with the variability that the world imposes. With advances in scientific tools for understanding biological structures in detail, we are increasingly able to identify design features that account for animals' robust performance. In parallel, advances in fabrication methods and materials are allowing us to engineer artificial structures with similar properties. The resulting robots become useful platforms for testing hypotheses about which principles are most important. Taking gecko-inspired climbing as an example, we show that the process of extracting principles from animals and adapting them to robots provides insights for both robotics and biology. 1.},

The model predicts success for perching over a range of initial conditions. The model also predicts the conditions under which other directional attachment technologies, such as microspines, will succeed. Experiments conducted using a launching mechanism for a range of different landing conditions confirm the predictions of the model and provide insight into future design improvements that are possible by modifying a few key damping and stiffness parameters.},

abstract = {Much research has been done recently on getting various UAVs to perch on various surfaces, however very little research has looked at how to detect when this perch has failed, especially when the surface the UAV is perched on is moving. This paper proposes a method to detect these types of falls using the Instantaneous Center of Rotation (ICR) of the UAV. Two methods are proposed to calculate this ICR, one based on integrating accelerometers to get velocities at various points on the UAV, the other based on using the magnitude of the acceleration at these points to estimate the distance to the ICR from that point. These methods provide a way to detect a fall from a moving perch that should work with different types of perching mechanisms and perches, while requiring minimal additional hardware on the UAV.},

abstract = {This paper presents the development and experimental validation of a bio-inspired autopilot, called TauPilot, based on the ecological tau theory proposed by the psychologist David Lee. Tau theory postulates that animals and humans use a combination of simple guidance strategies and the tau variable ({\{}tau{\}}) (representing time-to-contact) to prospectively guide and control most of their purposeful movements. This research investigates the feasibility and effectiveness of applying tau theory principles to guidance and control of movement in four dimensions (three spatial dimensions plus time), with application to various crucial maneuvres of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) such as braking, automated aerial docking and automatic landing. TauPilot includes a tau-guidance system, a tau-navigation system and a tau-controller, resulting in a four-dimensional (4D) guidance, navigation and control system that has the capability to accurately fit maneuvres or actions into 4D slots using only the universal temporal variable, tau. TauPilot has been integrated into two rotorcraft UAS and demonstrated in more than 1000 successful tau-controlled flights. TauPilot provided the UAS with the capability to perform the following maneuvres with high spatial and temporal accuracy: tau-braking, 4D straight- and curved-path tau-docking to a virtual target (a three-dimensional point in space), vertical and 4D coordinated tau-landing, and 4D tau-interception of a moving target point.},
